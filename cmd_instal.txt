Create a file Nav.vue in >resources>js>Shared

Make the Layout persistant in app.js
(no need to call it in every page that needs the Layout)

Make the active link active and 


27. 
Don't forget to get the Link component as a global component (app.js)


28. 
Make a Head component to display it on every page without calling it


29. 
Use the title in the Head component in the Layout as a fallback if you forget the 
title on a specific page


30.
Write the specific title in each page
Only works with this way of writing the Head component : <Head title=""></Head> 


31. 
Use head key to avoid duplicated meta description and to avoid the Layout to override
the Head component of other pages

You can call the title in app.js and add an element (DsL -) that will show in all 
title in addition of the title written in each Head component of each page
